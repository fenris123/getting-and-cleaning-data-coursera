# getting-and-cleaning-data-coursera
This repository  it’s made for the project of the coursera’s course  “getting and cleaning data”. https://class.coursera.org/getdata-013/human_grading

This script does the following:

1-takes 2 groups of 3 data files.
2-merges them in one data frame 
3-asign names to rows and columns
4-extract some columns of the data
5-with these data creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject


The data that we had use as a base can be downloaded from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

to work properly, the data must be extracted don your working directory. In simpler words,  the “UCI HAR Dataset” directory and all it’s content must be on your working directory.
